        <h1> How I play <a class= "myLinks" href="http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/">starcraft</a></h1>
        <h2> Practice </h2>



        <p class = "para_first_let"><span class = "firstLetter"></span>Starcraft is the most epic real time strategy game ever created. I have started to play starcraft since I was in middle school. It was such a hard game to start with for me because there are so many shortcut keys that I had to remember. For example, when I wanted to train a probe, it was faster for me to press "e" on the keyboard instead of clicking the probe icon on the screen. </p>

        <p class = "pFloat"> I did not give up on starcraft simply because it's hard. I kept playing and practising. Gradually, I was able to beat the "very hard" AI players. However, I still couldn't beat the "elite" level because I did not know how to play multi-lines. Multi-lines play is for example, attacking the enemy on the front, but drop several troops at the same time in enemy's back to harrass his economy.</p>

        </div>





        <p> Although I felt really wear out to take care of both the front and backs, I did it anyway. I failed a lot at the beginning because I could not handle both sides well. As a results, my drops didn't do any damage, and my big armies got crushed.</p>

        <p> The next thing I wanted to do is to beat actual players. I did this by playing ladders, a ranking system in starcraft. I successfully got to the gold rank, but it was very hard for me to go further because my APM was not fast enough. I improved my APM by playing more and more games, and I evantually became a starcraft pro player. </p>
